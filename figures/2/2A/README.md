Scripts:
- linear_assignment_neighborhood_expansion.py: Performs spatially constrained linear sum assignment iteratively by expanding the neighborhood parameter. Once for N slide 2 tracked anchors (generated by run_cell_tracking.py), once for randomly sampled N slide 2 anchors (5 seeds), and once without anchors. Saves results to Neighborhood_expansion_results.
- linear_assignment_no_constraints.py: Performs linear sum assignment without anchors and without spatial constraints. Saves results to Neighborhood_expansion_results.
- run_cell_tracking.py: Performs cell tracking. Saves results to Cell_tracking_results.
- run_coexist.py: Performs COEXIST matching. Saves results to COEXIST_results.
